# [kWSL.cmd - KDE Neon for WSL](https://github.com/thals1992/KDE-Neon-For-WSL)

- Net-install of KDE Neon on WSL1 using xRDP.
- Runs on Windows 10 AMD64 and Server 2019/2022 (including Hyper-V Core)
- xRDP Display Server; no additional Xserver download/configuration required
- High-quality RDP audio playback; video playback and YouTube work well and maintains audio sync.
- If you want to access kWSL remotely, Chrome Remote Desktop is pre-installed (Never expose RDP servers to the Internet.) Configuration steps are [**here**](https://github.com/thals1992/kWSL/wiki/Enable-Chrome-Remote-Desktop).

**IMPORTANT!**

- Windows 11 requires 22H2 Update *(Sun Valley 2, September 2022)*
- Windows Server / Windows 10 require latest updates from Windows Update.

## INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

From an elevated CMD.EXE prompt change to your desired install directory and type/paste the following command:

```batch
PowerShell -executionpolicy bypass -command "wget https://github.com/thals1992/KDE-Neon-For-WSL/raw/master/kWSL.cmd -UseBasicParsing -OutFile kWSL.cmd ; .\kWSL.cmd"
```

It will ask you a number of questions. At this time you should go with the default. bionic and jammy have not been verified, but all the steps are implemented.

## Add configuration to Windows Terminal

- Open up the following file:
  - ````%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json````
- Add the following JSON code to add three new profiles:
  - Here, we're adding a profile for root, the placeholder "whoopsie" user, and the init profile.  
    - The init profile is the same as the Windows Service created and can be ended by entering ```0``` and it will terminate that tab/window without needing to start/stop the service.  

```json
            {
                "guid": "{5f586e18-4020-5ce0-8544-13d847006eba}",
                "hidden": false,
                "name": "NeonWSL (root)",
                "source": "Windows.Terminal.Wsl"
            },
            {
                "colorScheme": "Campbell",
                "commandline": "C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WSL.exe ~ -u whoopsie -d NeonWSL",
                "guid": "{4228dd61-1063-4eb6-8366-424744fd0cd4}",
                "hidden": false,
                "icon": "ms-appx:///ProfileIcons/{9acb9455-ca41-5af7-950f-6bca1bc9722f}.png",
                "name": "NeonWSL",
                "startingDirectory": "~"
            },
            {
                "colorScheme": "Campbell",
                "commandline": "C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WSL.EXE ~ -u root -d NeonWSL -e initwsl 2",
                "guid": "{e70d6a43-997e-424c-abf0-5705c60a3b71}",
                "hidden": false,
                "icon": "ms-appx:///ProfileIcons/{9acb9455-ca41-5af7-950f-6bca1bc9722f}.png",
                "name": "NeonWSL Init",
                "startingDirectory": "~"
            }
```

## Configure kWSL to start at boot (like a service, no console window)

- Right-click the task in Task Scheduler, click properties
- Click the checkbox for **Run whether user is logged on or not** and click **OK**
- Enter your Windows credentials when prompted

 Reboot your PC when complete and kWSL will startup automatically.

## Convert WSL Instance

Example of conversion to WSL2:

- Stop WSL instance (Using default instance name *NeonWSL* in this example):
 ````wslconfig /t NeonWSL````
- Convert the instance to WSL2:
 ````wsl --set-version NeonWSL 2````
- Restart KDE Neon Instance:
 ````schtasks /run /tn NeonWSL````

Restart the instance when the conversion is complete: `schtasks.exe /run /tn NeonWSL`

Procedure is the same for switching back to WSL1: ````wsl --set-version NeonWSL 1````

## Make it your own

From a security standpoint, it would be best to fork this project so you (and only you) control the packages and files in the repository.

- Sign into GitHub and fork this project
- Edit ```kWSL.cmd```.  On line 2 you will see ```SET GITORG=thals1992``` - Change ```thals1992``` to the name of your own repository.
- Customize the script any way you like.
- Launch the script using your repository name:
 ```PowerShell -executionpolicy bypass -command "wget https://github.com/YOUR-REPO-NAME/kWSL/raw/master/kWSL.cmd -UseBasicParsing -OutFile kWSL.cmd ; .\kWSL.cmd"```

## Quirks / Limitations / Additional Info

- When you log out out of a KDE session the WSL instance is restarted.  This is the equivilent to having a freshly-booted desktop environment at every login, but the 'reboot' process only takes about 5 seconds.  
- kWSL should work fine with an X Server instead of xRDP but this has not been thoroughly tested.  The file ```/etc/profile.d/kWSL.sh``` contains WSL-centric environment variables that may need adjustment such as LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT.
- Plasma-discover doesn't work in Server 2019 / Win 10 v.1809 -- The installer will remove it if you're running an affected OS.
- WSL1 Doesn't work with PolicyKit.  Enabled kdesu for apps needing elevated rights (plasma-discover, ksystemlog, muon, root console.)
- KDE Lockscreen is disabled (due to policykit)  
- Patched KDE Activity Manager to disable WAL in sqlite3.
- Mozilla Seamonkey is included as a stable/maintained browser.
- QtWebEngine (Chromium-based) browsers like Falkon and Konqueror now work. (July/21)
- Installed image consumes approximately 3 GB of disk space.
- Apt-fast added to improve download speed and reliability.
- Default installation uses the Breeze theme and Windows fonts (Segoe UI / Cascadia Code)
- Compositor replaced with Picom for better RDP performance and includes the [Klassy](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/wju5g9/klassy_v40_window_decoration_application_style/) window decoration / application style plugin
- This is a basic installation of KDE to save bandwidth.  If you want the **complete** KDE Desktop environment (+3GB Disk) run ```sudo pkcon -y install neon-all```
